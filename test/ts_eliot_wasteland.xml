      <title>I. The Burial of the Dead</title>
      <lines outputclass="stanza">
April is the cruellest month, breeding 
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing 
Memory and desire, stirring 
Dull roots with spring rain. 
Winter kept us warm, covering 
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding 
A little life with dried tubers. 
Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee 
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, 
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,<ph outputclass="line-number-annotation">10</ph> 
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. 
Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch. 
And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s, 
My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled, 
And I was frightened. He said, Marie, 
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. 
In the mountains, there you feel free. 
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

You cannot say, or guess, for you know only 
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, 
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, 
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only 
There is shadow under this red rock, 
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock), 
And I will show you something different from either 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.<ph outputclass="line-number-annotation">30</ph>

Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, 
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, 
I had not thought death had undone so many. 
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, 
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. 
Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, 
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours 
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.

    <title>Notes on <i>The Waste Land</i></title>
    <body>
      <p> Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem
        were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston’s book on the Grail legend: <cite>From Ritual to
          Romance</cite> (Macmillan).<fn>Macmillan] Cambridge</fn> Indeed, so deeply am I indebted,
        Miss Weston’s book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can
        do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think
        such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am
        indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean The Golden
        Bough; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris. Anyone who is
        acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem certain references to
        vegetation ceremonies. </p>

          I have obviously departed to suit my own convenience. The Hanged Man, a member of the
          traditional pack, fits my purpose in two ways: because he is associated in my mind with
          the Hanged God of Frazer, and because I associate him with the hooded figure in the
          passage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V. The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant
          appear later; also the <q>crowds of people,</q> and Death by Water is executed in Part IV.
          The Man with Three Staves (an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite
          arbitrarily, with the Fisher King himself.</p>

        <p>218. Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a <q>character,</q> is yet the
          most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant,
          seller of currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly
          distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman, and the two
          sexes meet in Tiresias. What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem. The
          whole passage from Ovid is of great anthropological interest:</p>

Quam, quae contingit maribus,’ dixisse, ‘voluptas.&#x2019; 
Illa negat; placuit quae sit sententia docti 
Quaerere Tiresiae: venus huic erat utraque nota. 
Nam duo magnorum viridi coeuntia silva 
Corpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu 
Deque viro factus, mirabile, femina septem 
Egerat autumnos; octavo rursus eosdem 
Vidit et ‘est vestrae si tanta potentia plagae,&#x315; 
Dixit `ut auctoris sortem in contraria mutet, 
Nunc quoque vos feriam!’ percussis anguibus isdem 
Forma prior rediit genetivaque venit imago. 
Arbiter hic igitur sumptus de lite iocosa 
Dicta Iovis firmat; gravius Saturnia iusto 
Nec pro materia fertur doluisse suique 
Iudicis aeterna damnavit lumina nocte, 
At pater omnipotens (neque enim licet inrita cuiquam 
Facta dei fecisse deo) pro lumine adempto 
Scire futura dedit poenamque levavit honore.”</lines>

        <title>What the Thunder Said</title>
        <p> In the first part of Part V three themes are employed: the journey to Emmaus, the
          approach to the Chapel Perilous (see Miss Weston’s book) and the present decay of eastern
          Europe.</p>
        <p>357. This is Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii, the hermit-thrush which I have heard in Quebec
          County. Chapman says (Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America) <q>it is most at home in
            secluded woodland and thickety retreats. . . . Its notes are not remarkable for variety
            or volume, but in purity and sweetness of tone and exquisite modulation they are
            unequalled.</q> Its <q>water-dripping song</q> is justly celebrated.</p>
        <p>360. The following lines were stimulated by the account of one of the Antarctic
          expeditions (I forget which, but I think one of Shackleton’s): it was related that the
          party of explorers, at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion that
          there was one more member than could actually be counted.</p>
        <p>367--77. Cf. Hermann Hesse, Blick ins Chaos:</p>
        <p><q>Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem Wege zum
            Chaos, fȁhrt betrunken im heiligem Wahn am Abgrund entlang und singt dazu, singt
            betrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang. Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bȕrger
            beleidigt, der Heilige und Seher hȍrt sie mit Trȁnen.</q></p>
        <p>402. <q>Datta, dayadhvam, damyata</q> (Give, sympathize, control). The fable of the
          meaning of the Thunder is found in the Brihadaranyaka-Upanishad, 5, 1. A translation is
          found in Deussen’s Sechzig Upanishads des Veda, p. 489.</p>
        <p>408. Cf. Webster, The White Devil, v. vi:</p>
        <lines><ph outputclass="indent: 2.5in"/>            “&#x2026; they’ll remarry 
<ph outputclass="indent"/>Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet, ere the spider

        <p>412. Cf. Inferno, xxxiii. 46:</p>
        <p><ph outputclass="indent"/><ph outputclass="indent"/>“ed io sentii chiavar l’uscio di
          sotto <ph outputclass="indent"/><ph outputclass="indent"/>all’orribile torre.﻿”</p>
        <p>Also F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, p. 346:</p>
        <lq>
          <p>“My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my
            feelings. In either case my experience falls within my own circle, a circle closed on
            the outside; and, with all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others
            which surround it. . . . In brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul, the
            whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.﻿”</p>
